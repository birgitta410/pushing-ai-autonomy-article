Example result of the workflow

* Date: July 18, 2025
* Tool: Roo Code
* Model: Claude 4
* Time to run: ~1 hour

### Results

* Requirements: Nice separation into library and author aggregate
* During E2E test generation, it created both `src/e2e/java/com/gen/example/officelibrary` AND `src/e2e/java/com.gen.example.officelibrary` folders, which later led to problems when executing the test suites.
* At the end of the run, the unit/integration test suite was still failing, had to nudge it to fix those. After that was fixed, the E2E tests were failing again - which is where I stopped.
